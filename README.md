# Alexey Shiklomanov's personal website

On this site, I will try to share tips and tricks I've accumulatd related to programming, data analysis, research, and graduate student life in general. 

This site is operated through the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) blogging system and is hosted by [GitHub](https://github.com). 
My current theme of choice is a tweaked version of the [zetsu theme](github.com/nandomoreirame/zetsu). 
All of the code for this website is publicly available in my [GitHub repository]({{ site.github }}).
